# Recursive_Feature_Elimination
Recursive feature elimination for MATLAB's fitcsvm

This code combines Rescursive Feature Elimination (RFE) as described in Guyon et al. 2002: Gene Selection for Cancer 
Classification using Support Vector Machines, with Matlab's newest Support Vector Machine (SVM) Implementation; namely fitcsvm.

The code is based on KE YAN's code where RFE was combined with the older Matlab SVM implementation (namely svmtrain):
